* If you haven't provisioned your virtual server yet, see [step 2](./2_provision.md) for instructions.
* If you're a Mac user, go [here](./3_mac_connect.md) instead.
* Get your IP address for your virtual server [here](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/instance) from IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud.
* Follow the steps laid out in the [fast start guide](https://github.com/linuxone-community-cloud/technical-resources/blob/master/faststart/PUTTY_Set_up.pdf) provided by the LinuxONE Community Cloud.
